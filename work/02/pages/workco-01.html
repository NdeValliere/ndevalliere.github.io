        <p class="text__brow">Requirements</p>
        <p class="">One important aspect was to take advantage of the vast amount of pre-existing content from Planned Parenthood. It should be repackaged in a way that remains current for a long time and requires minimal maintenance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="">A chatbot would most effectively fulfill all these requirements.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="">Research showed that teenagers remember information most accurately if they process it at a heightened emotional state. Therefore we also came up with two game based ideas.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class=" text__brow">Visuals</p>
        <p class="">The visual design lead came up with the style of an 8bit game. I created backgrounds and character variations to fit under the predefined styleguide.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="">I tried to come up with characters that fit within the defined colour scheme of the brand guidelines and reflected a range of different ethnic groups.</p>

        <p class="text__brow">Prototyping</p>
        <p class="">Following the flow designed the UX lead of the team I created a prototype of the game.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="">"Happy Place" is a scenario based role-playing game. An example would be to help a friend deal with their first crush. The user is presented with questions and multiple answers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="text__brow">Reflection</p>
        <p class="">I learned how to prototype products not just with a focus on structural clarity but also with an emphasis on motion and hierarchy through type, colour and layout.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="">It has become apparent to me how small details can evoke moments of joy for the user. It is something I hope to integrate in all of my future work.</p>
