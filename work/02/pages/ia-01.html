        <p class="">To begin, I documented the current structure of the iA Writer product website. This way I would be sure that no pre-existing content would go forgotten. It gave me an overview of what needed to be restructured as well as redesigned.</p>

        <p >The redesign was focused on showcasing the various features of the app. There were mountains of great content but I found there was no cohesive visual language to demonstrate the range of capabilities of the app. Much of the information was spread across different mediums such as blog posts, videos and news articles. With the redesign we wanted everything to be concentrated in one area in the same style.</p>
        <p >&nbsp;</p>
        <p >So we could keep featuring video content, we decided to match the style of the website to that of the videos. Using the colour of the cursor of the logo of the app for banners, buttons and links I tried to make it obvious which content was connected to each other while distinguishing it from the content of the company website of iA Inc.</p>

        <p >The redesign addressed the issue of drawing more attention to the download page and the fact that there is a free trial available of the app. I tried to make the call-to-action more clear. We decided to add an entire page dedicated to download links.</p>
        <p >&nbsp;</p>
        <p >The visual content was edited and / or made by me using Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and Sketch. The lead designer provided a range of references and materials for me to use. Often the perfect size was slightly pixelated or the composition of the devices did not fit with the layout of the website. I made custom solutions based on these references. I tried as often as possible to use vector based formats. I created elements that could be used in multiple situations to make new imagery for unique design problems.</p>

        <p >I made the first mockups of the redesigned website in Axure RP Pro. After the first feedback session I decided to continue the redesign in HTML5 and SCSS. I thought it would give me a chance to practice and learn more. Overall I felt more confident in my coding skills at the end of this project. It gave me the experience necessary to start experimenting with content management systems and theme development for websites on my own.</p>
