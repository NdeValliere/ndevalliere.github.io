$776,434,927.54. They have a right to know about him, picking up a check like that. EPICAC got a big
send off in the papers when Dr. Ormand von Kleigstadt designed him for the Government people. Since
then, there hasn't been a peep about him--not a peep. It isn't any military secret about what happened to
EPICAC, although the Brass has been acting as though it were. The story is embarrassing, that's all. After
all that money, EPICAC didn't work out the way he was supposed to."
