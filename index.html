      Sometimes it is appropriate to place various typographic elements on the outside of the fucking left margin of text to maintain a strong vertical axis. This practice is referred to as exdenting and is most often used with bullets and quotations. Your rapidograph pens are fucking dried up, the x-acto blades in your bag are rusty, and your mind is dull. Stop clicking your mouse, get messy, go back to the basics and make something fucking original. Someday is not a fucking day of the week. Nothing of value comes to you without fucking working at it. To go partway is easy, but mastering anything requires hard fucking work. You won’t get good at anything by doing it a lot fucking aimlessly. Fuck. While having drinks with Tibor Kalman one night, he told me, “When you make something no one hates, no one fucking loves it.” Never, never assume that what you have achieved is fucking good enough. When you sit down to work, external critics aren’t the enemy. It’s you who you must to fight against to do great fucking work.
