  <!-- THIS IS NOT A BLOG. I didn't use a fucking CMS or a pre-coded / pre-designed template. Every single gradient, block of colour, font choice, layout and shitty line of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery was created, designed AND written by me unless clearly stated otherwise (e.g. the multitude of js libraries ...) but thanks for presuming I'm such a fucking moron that I'd only be able to create such a large body of work if I were to use a BLOG.-->

        <p class="row__body"><b>What was the objective of this project?</b></p>
        <p class="row__body">Design the 2017 festive digital campaign visual for UAL. This can be a static or animated image, and will be used on all UAL websites, email campaigns and college screens.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="row__body"><b>What did I do?</b></p>
        <p class="row__body">I wanted to create something playful and festive but still relatively neutral as to not alienate any particular beliefs or traditions. I experimented with interactive type and gravitated towards outcomes where the type seemed almost like objects, such as snow or presents falling / dancing around you.</p>
