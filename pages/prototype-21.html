Use of Japanese-inspired use of silhouettes and creation of dynamic spatial relationships with flat colours and shapes. The triple repetition of the club's name draws the focus down to the central figure of the poster. Toulouse-Lautrec's boldly simplistic, symbolic, highly communicative style is a sharp break from the text-heavy posters of the day.</p>

            <h3 class="block__artist">Stenberg Brothers</h3>
            <p class="block__body">Shift from the illustrator-as-creator to the constructor-as-creator or nonlinear-narrator-as-creator. In the visual language of the constructor or Constructivist, the Stenbergs and other graphic designers and artists assembled images, such as portions of photographs and preprinted paper, that had been created by others. Thus, the Stenbergs and others realized wholly new images (or compositions) which were no longer about realism. Hence, graphic design as a modern expression eschewing traditional fine art was born in the form of the printed reproductions of collage or assemblage. One of the causes of the avant-garde artists in the new Russia, who considered fine art to be useless, was served when the Stenbergs and others as constructors-as-creators produced posters that had a use, particularly to serve the state. Commercial graphic design and advertising is propaganda, the dissemination of propaganda (пропаганды) was considered a desirable and honorable practice in Russia at the time. In fact, the Bolsheviks, who sought to reform the peasant class, considered film to be a potent propaganda tool for communicating with a widely illiterate population.</p>

            <h3 class="block__artist">El Lissitzky</h3>
            <p class="block__body">The essence of New Vision photography is pointedly expressed in this picture, commonly known as The Constructor, which puts the act of seeing at center stage. Lissitzky's hand, holding a compass, is superimposed on a shot of his head that explicitly highlights his eye: insight, it expresses, is passed through the eye and transmitted to the hand, and through it to the tools of production. Devised from six different exposures, the picture merges Lissitzky's personae as photographer (eye) and constructor of images (hand) into a single likeness. Contesting the idea that straight photography provides a single, unmediated truth, Lissitzky held instead that montage, with its layering of one meaning over another, impels the viewer to reconsider the world. It thus marks a conceptual shift in the understanding of what a picture can be.</p>

            <p class="block__body">Based on geometric shapes that became representative of visual elements of the Bauhaus design style of 1919–33. Futura has an appearance of efficiency and forwardness. Although Renner was not associated with the Bauhaus, he shared many of its idioms and believed that a modern typeface should express modern models, rather than be a revival of a previous design. Renner's design rejected the approach of most previous sans-serif designs (now often called grotesques), which were based on the models of signpainting, condensed lettering and nineteenth-century serif typefaces, in favour of simple geometric forms: near-perfect circles, triangles and squares. It is based on strokes of near-even weight, which are low in contrast. The lowercase has tall ascenders, which rise above the cap line, and uses a single-story 'a' and 'g', previously more common in handwriting than in printed text.</p>

All John Heartfield art was “art as a weapon” whether he used it against fascism, accepted art norms, or what the Dadaists believed was art’s cooperation with the corrupt society of the Weimar Republic.</p>

            <h3 class="block__artist">Herbert Matter</h3>
            <p class="block__body">Herbert Matter (1907-1984) created the 1934 Swiss tourism poster and was instrumental in creating posters which used a photomontage effect whereas multiple photo's would be edited onto one final production piece.  This new "image of images" was then photographed into a seamless picture for poster use.  "Before color photography, Matter who was known as a darkroom perfectionist who could achieve a freshness and harmony in his colors and photographic surfaces by dyeing various elements photo-chemically." The art of photomontage had its roots in Berlin after the First World War whereas a group known as Dada lead by John Heartfeld and George Grosz were experimenting with new art forms without using paint for art.  "Matter’s advanced techniques in graphic design and photography became part of a new visual narrative that began in the 1930s, which have since evolved into familiar design idioms such as overprinting—where an image extends beyond the frame—and the bold use of color, size, and placement in typography. Such techniques often characterize both pre-war European Modernism and the post-war expression of that movement in the United States." Some of Matter's posters follow a design that is rooted in the early 1930s, whereas the close cropped, "heroic head" is at the forefront of the poster.  The presentation of this "herioc head" with little or no facial expression that stares away from the viewer gives the impression of aloofness and total dedication to a greater power."</p>

            <h3 class="block__artist">Paul Rand</h3>
            <p class="block__body">Marguerite Tjader Harris was the daughter of a wealthy Connecticut munitions manufacturer. She was intent on having Rand design covers for Direction, an arts and culture magazine that she published on a shoestring, which featured articles by Le Corbusier, Jean Cocteau, and other avant-gardists. She offered Rand no recompense, but plenty of freedom and, ultimately, a couple of original Le Corbusier drawings. But Rand has another motive, “In a country that was used to decorative work, the common sense way to have what I was doing accepted was to do it for free,”. Each Direction cover illustrated a particular theme or point of view; the first, and his most politically astute, showed a map of Czechoslovakia torn in half, representing the nation’s evisceration by the Nazis. Contrasted with an E. McKnight Kauffer Direction covers showing a realistic hand impaled by a Nazi dagger, Rand’s abstract depiction was both subtle and eloquent. Rand avoided conventional propagandistic tools in favor of imagery he believed would serve as both art and message. </p>

            <h2 class="block__title">As We May Think</h2>
            <h3 class="block__artist">Vannevar Bush</h3>
            <p class="block__body">Many scientists, especially physicists, get new duties during the War. Now, after the war, they need new duties.</p>
            <p class="block__body">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="block__body">Section 1: The use of Science has improved tremendously in many ways for humans. The knowledge of science has grown considerably. However, the way we manage it still remains the same for centuries. We are no longer able to use what Science finds out. Alternatively, the technology has matured greatly and allows us to now produce complicated, yet cheap and dependable machines.</p>
            <p class="block__body">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="block__body">Section 2: Science is really useful. However, in order to have it to be very efficient and useful it should not only be stored but also be frequently consulted and enhanced. In the future we would probably be able to store human writings in a small room with the use of photography.</p>
            <p class="block__body">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="block__body">Section 3: Using the latest advances of speech recording and stenography, we will soon be able to make printing immediate. The advancement of photography is not going to stop. The thought process of repetition could be in relation to machine. Electrical machines will be the advancement of arithmetical computation.</p>
            <p class="block__body">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="block__body">Section 4: There is more to the scientific reasoning than just arithmetic. There are a few machines that are not used for arithmetic, partly due to the market’s needs. Solving higher mathematics require other repetitive processes of thought to be mechanized.</p>

        <section class="description__block description__block--30">
          <section class="description__block">
            <p class="block__body">Section 5: A machine could be used anywhere where there is logical thought process. At this moment we do not have the necessary tools for the selection (the key to utilize science) of knowledge. One of the best forms of selection is illustrated by the automatic telephone exchange.</p>
            <p class="block__body">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="block__body">Section 6: There is a problem with selection. The main problem of it is the deficiency of the indexing systems. When data is recorded and put into storage, it is usually filed alphabetically or numerically. The human mind works differently. It works according to association. Instead of using selection by indexing, selection by association may be mechanized. Thus, improving the permanence and clarity of the items stored. The memex is a device that could store information and communication (large memory). Some things that can be entered are, newspaper and books. The user is also able to find a particular book as he or she taps on its code on the keyboard. The codes that are frequently used to call forth pages are mnemonic and its possible to browse these pages at different speeds.</p>
            <p class="block__body">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="block__body">Section 7: The main feature of the memex is the ability to tie two things together at will. In other words, to be able to associate two arbitrary items when wanted. The user is also able to build a trail, in which they name it, insert a name into the code book, and then taps it out on the keyboard. At any time, the user is able to view two items at the same time, parallel viewing. It is also possible to pass items to another memex.</p>
            <p class="block__body">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="block__body">Section 8: The trails made can be shared with others and can also be published, like an encyclopedia (many more new forms are to appear). Soon we will be able to establish some kind of direct connection with absorbing material of the record with one of our senses, tactilely, orally, and visually. It would be great for humans to be able analyze present issues. As of now, science has been applied to live better, as well as for destruction. Possibly we may be able to apply the record to become wiser.</p>

            <p class="block__body">A series of symbols that could quickly summarize the spirit of each book, were established. The personal and subjective concept of each book was taken and the attempt was made to objectify and project it in visual form. The jackets were always planned for maximum visual effectiveness when displayed together, as well as when shown singly against the confused background of the average bookstore.</p>

            <h3 class="block__artist">Claude Shannon</h3>
            <p class="block__body">This work focuses on the problem of how best to encode the information a sender wants to transmit. In this fundamental work, he used tools in probability theory, developed by Norbert Wiener, which were in their nascent stages of being applied to communication theory at that time. Shannon developed information entropy as a measure of the uncertainty in a message while essentially inventing the field of information theory. Information theory's fundamental contribution to natural language processing and computational linguistics was further established in 1951, in his article "Prediction and Entropy of Printed English", showing upper and lower bounds of entropy on the statistics of English – giving a statistical foundation to language analysis. In addition, he proved that treating whitespace as the 27th letter of the alphabet actually lowers uncertainty in written language, providing a clear quantifiable link between cultural practice and probabilistic cognition.</p>

            <h2 class="block__title">CBS Symbol</h2>
            <h3 class="block__artist">William Golden</h3>
            <p class="block__body">The famous eye symbol was developed to provide special identification for CBS Television. Kurt Weihs, who was involved in the project, remembers that the eye had its beginnings in an article in Portfolio about the then relatively esoteric subject of Shaker design. “Among the illustrations was an eye symbol. Golden picked it up and used it for a CBS sales portfolio. Then he felt there was more to it and used it in an ad. I redesigned the earlier versions, and it became the mark for CBS Television. We had done eyes before. Everybody had done eyes; but this one was something that really worked. I felt that the eye could have become the corporate symbol. We saw the eye as symbolizing CBS 'looking at the world.'” William Golden applied new ideas, forms, and methods to the world of advertising and promotional graphics. The body of his work endures as a milestone in the history of graphic design. Providing a map of uncharted territory, Golden's program of promotional advertising and identity design for CBS was innovative and set a standard of excellence which has endured over the years. “I think that all the trouble in this field comes from someone's assumption that they are, maybe, the same person. I think the fine artist makes a personal statement about his world and his reactions to his world. He makes it to a limited audience or to a big audience—but it's all his. The advertising designer has a completely different function. He may be someone who thought he wanted to be a painter—but wasn't. If (the designer) is honest enough, he becomes a professional who can do something that is not his own. I think the trouble comes when he tries to make it a work of art, too. I think a lot of designers who are talented and intelligent don't find this very satisfying. But they're not going to find it more satisfying by pretending it's something it isn't.”</p>

            <p class="block__body">Released by his employer Deberny & Peignot in 1957. Classified as a neo-grotesque sans-serif, one based on the model of nineteenth-century German typefaces such as Akzidenz-Grotesk, it was notable for its availability from the moment of its launch in a comprehensive range of weights and widths. The original marketing for Univers deliberately referenced the periodic table to emphasise its scope. Univers was one of the first typeface families to fulfil the idea that a typeface should form a family of consistent, related designs. Past sans-serif designs such as Gill Sans had much greater differences between weights</p>

            <h3 class="block__artist">Saul Bass</h3>
            <p class="block__body">He created an arresting image of a distorted, disjointed arm. The semi-abstract form helped distance the image from the harsh realities of shooting up, although they are implicit in the (dis)figuration. As well as being disconnected from a body, the black arm has the appearance of being petrified and transformed into something else, just as the Sinatra character in the film is transformed by his addiction. The title sequence was equally compelling. Here was modern art on the movie screen. Saul stated that, “The intent of this opening was to create a mood spare, gaunt, with a driving intensity… [that conveyed] the distortion and jaggedness, the disconnectedness and disjointedness of the addict’s life the subject of the film.” Accompanied by Elmer Bernstein’s driving jazz-like score, and set against a black background, white bars appear, disappear and form abstract patterns before finally coalescing into the film’s symbol. Contrasts between the black and white heighten the strident intensity, and the disjunctures encapsulate the mood of the main character, a downbeat drummer with a penchant for gambling and drugs.</p>

            <h3 class="block__artist">Darko Fritz, Jose Maria Yturralde, Vladimir Bonacic</h3>
            <p class="block__body">This recent MIT press publication documents a short-lived but intense artistic experiment that took place in Yugoslavia fifty years ago but has been influential far beyond that time and place: the New Tendencies movement, which begun in Zagreb in 1961. Pursuing the idea of “art as visual research"” the New Tendencies movement proceeded along a path that led from Concrete and Constructivist art, Op art, and Kinetic art to computer-generated graphics, film, and sculpture.

With their exhibitions and conferences and the 1968 launch of the multilingual, groundbreaking magazine Bit International, the New Tendencies transformed Zagreb into an international meeting place where artists, engineers, and scientists from both sides of the Iron Curtain gathered around the then-new technology. For a brief moment in time, Zagreb was the epicenter of explorations of the aesthetic, scientific, and political potential of the computer.</p>

            <p class="block__body">He invented Sketchpad in 1962 while at MIT. Professor Claude Shannon signed on to supervise Sutherland’s computer drawing thesis. Among others on his thesis committee were Marvin Minsky and Steven Coons. Sketchpad was an innovative program that influenced alternative forms of interaction with computers. Sketchpad could accept constraints and specified relationships among segments and arcs, including the diameter of arcs. It could draw both horizontal and vertical lines and combine them into figures and shapes. Figures could be copied, moved, rotated, or resized, retaining their basic properties. Sketchpad also had the first window-drawing program and clipping algorithm, which allowed zooming.</p>

            <h3 class="block__artist">Karl Gerstner</h3>
            <p class="block__body"> In four essays, the author provides a basic introduction to his design methodology. Instead of set recipes, the method suggests a model for design in the early days of the computer era. The intellectual models it proposes, however, continue to be useful today. What it does not purvey is cut-and-dried, true-or-false solutions or absolutes of any kind - instead, it develops fundamental principles in an innovative and future-oriented way. The book is especially topical and exciting in the context of current developments in computational design, which seem to hold out the possibility of programmed design. With many examples from the worlds of graphic and product design, music, architecture, and art, it inspires the reader to seize on the material, develop it further, and integrate it into his or her own work.</p>

            <p class="block__body">When Warhol first exhibited these Campbell’s Soup Cans in 1962, they were displayed together on shelves, like products in a grocery aisle. Though Campbell’s Soup Cans resembles the mass-produced, printed advertisements by which Warhol was inspired, it is hand-painted. In this work, he mimicked the repetition and uniformity of advertising by carefully reproducing the same image across each individual canvas. He varied only the label on the front of each can, distinguishing them by their variety. Towards the end of 1962, shortly after he completed Campbell’s Soup Cans, Warhol turned to the photo-silkscreen process. A printmaking technique originally invented for commercial use, it would become his signature medium and link his art making methods more closely to those of advertisements.</p>

The effect was so jarring that museum guards were given permission to wear sunglasses. New York Times critic John Canaday heralded the exhibition, which was organized by William C. Seitz and featured geometric abstractions from artists ranging from British artist Bridget Riley to former Josef Albers student Richard Anuszkiewicz, as “one of the most exciting artistic events in a decade.” While the show was divisive, one thing was certain: with its crisp, clean lines and high-tech appeal was the perfect visual expression for the space age.</p>

The perspective that the software showed the user would depend on the position of the user's gaze—which is why head tracking was necessary. The weight of Sutherland's HMD, and the need to track the head movements necessitated the HMD being attached to a mechanical arm suspended from the ceiling of the lab. The formidable appearance of the mechanism inspired its name. First steps toward Augmented Reality.</p>

            <p class="block__body">The live demonstration featured the introduction of a complete computer hardware and software system called the oN-Line System or, more commonly, NLS. The 90-minute presentation essentially demonstrated almost all the fundamental elements of modern personal computing: windows, hypertext, graphics, efficient navigation and command input, video conferencing, the computer mouse, word processing, dynamic file linking, revision control, and a collaborative real-time editor (collaborative work). Engelbart's presentation was the first to publicly demonstrate all of these elements in a single system. The demonstration was highly influential and spawned similar projects at Xerox PARC in the early 1970s. The underlying technologies influenced both the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows graphical user interface operating systems in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>

            <p class="block__body">NLS, or the "oN-Line System", was a revolutionary computer collaboration system from the 1960s. Designed by Douglas Engelbart and implemented by researchers at the Augmentation Research Center (ARC) at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), the NLS system was the first to employ the practical use of hypertext links, the mouse, raster-scan video monitors, information organized by relevance, screen windowing, presentation programs, and other modern computing concepts. It was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, NASA, and the U.S. Air Force.</p>
