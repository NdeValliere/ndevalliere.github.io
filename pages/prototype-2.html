    <p>The graphic designer’s first fucking consideration is always the size and shape of the format, whether for the printed page or for digital display. Creativity is a fucking work-ethic. If you’re not being fucking honest with yourself how could you ever hope to communicate something meaningful to someone else? Widows and orphans are terrible fucking tragedies, both in real life and definitely in typography. Design as if your fucking life depended on it. To go partway is easy, but mastering anything requires hard fucking work.</p>
    <p>What’s important is the fucking drive to see a project through no matter what. Widows and orphans are terrible fucking tragedies, both in real life and definitely in typography. When you sit down to work, external critics aren’t the enemy. It’s you who you must to fight against to do great fucking work. You must overcome yourself. Learn from fucking criticism.</p>
    <p>You are not your fucking work. When you design, you have to draw on your own fucking life experiences. If it’s not something you would want to read/look at/use then why fucking bother? Design as if your fucking life depended on it. Never, never assume that what you have achieved is fucking good enough. Remember it’s called the creative process, it’s not the creative fucking moment. You need to sit down and sketch more fucking ideas because stalking your ex on facebook isn’t going to get you anywhere. Intuition is fucking important. Never, never assume that what you have achieved is fucking good enough.</p>
    <p>If you fucking give up, you will achieve nothing. Someday is not a fucking day of the week. While having drinks with Tibor Kalman one night, he told me, “When you make something no one hates, no one fucking loves it.” Creativity is a fucking work-ethic. Design is all about fucking relationships—the relationship of form and content, the relationship of elements, the relationship  of designer and user. Form follows fucking function.</p>
    <p>  Paul Rand once said, “The public is more familiar with bad fucking design than good design. It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is what it lives with. The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring.” You need to sit down and sketch more fucking ideas because stalking your ex on facebook isn’t going to get you anywhere. Form follows fucking function. Intuition is fucking important. A good fucking composition is the result of a hierarchy consisting of clearly contrasting elements set with distinct alignments containing irregular intervals of negative space.</p>
    <p>Paul Rand once said, “The public is more familiar with bad fucking design than good design. It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is what it lives with.

    <p>Your rapidograph pens are fucking dried up, the x-acto blades in your bag are rusty, and your mind is dull. Stop clicking your mouse, get messy, go back to the basics and make something fucking original. Intuition is fucking important. You need to sit down and sketch more fucking ideas because stalking your ex on facebook isn’t going to get you anywhere. While having drinks with Tibor Kalman one night, he told me, “When you make something no one hates, no one fucking loves it.” Saul Bass on failure: Failure is built into creativity… the creative act involves this element of ‘newness’ and ‘experimentalism,’ then one must expect and accept the fucking possibility of failure. To surpass others is fucking tough, if you only do as you are told you don’t have it in you to succeed.</p>

Sometimes it is appropriate to place various typographic elements on the outside of the fucking left margin of text to maintain a strong vertical axis. This practice is referred to as exdenting and is most often used with bullets and quotations.</p>
    <p>Creativity is a fucking work-ethic. Design as if your fucking life depended on it. Practice won’t get you anywhere if you mindlessly fucking practice the same thing. Change only occurs when you work deliberately with purpose toward a goal. Respect your fucking craft. Practice won’t get you anywhere if you mindlessly fucking practice the same thing.

    <p>Must-do is a good fucking master. Think about all the fucking possibilities. Can we all just agree as the greater design community to stop fucking talking about Comic Sans altogether? It’s getting fucking old. This design is fucking brilliant.</p>
