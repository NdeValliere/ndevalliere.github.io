            <h3 class="block__artist">Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec</h3>
            <p class="block__body">Although Moulin Rouge: La Goulue was Toulouse-Lautrec's first attempt at lithography, such was his grasp of the medium's possibilities that it was an immediate sensation. 3000 copies spread around Paris captivated the public with their eye-catching design, bold colors, and innovative, Japanese-inspired use of silhouettes. The triple repetition of the club's name draws the focus down to the central figure of the poster, La Goulue herself. The stark white of her petticoats, depicted with just a few lines on the white paper, epitomizes Toulouse-Lautrec's boldly simplistic style, a sharp break from the text-heavy posters of the day.</p>

            <p class="block__body">This poster advertises the one-act play A Chapter from Don Quixote by W. G. Wills at the Lyceum Theatre, London. Using their distinctive collage technique, The Beggarstaffs designed three versions of this monumental and sombre poster for a production starring Henry Irving. Their approach was a radical departure for theatrical advertising, and Irving declined to use it, declaring he wanted 'No more mills!' He similarly rejected a later Beggarstaffs' design for the play Robespierre. Although not seen on the hoardings, this poster for A Chapter from Don Quixote was influential through its illustration in various periodicals.</p>

Used photography to frame the world from new points of view—from above, below, and at other unexpected, sharp angles—encouraging the viewer to see familiar things in new ways. Embraced it as a tool for social commentary.</p>

            <h3 class="block__artist">Herbert Bayer</h3>
            <p class="block__body">Artistic polymath Herbert Bayer was one of the Bauhaus’s most influential students, teachers, and proponents, advocating the integration of all arts throughout his career. Bayer began his studies as an architect in 1919 in Darmstadt. From 1921 to 1923 he attended the Bauhaus in Weimar, studying mural painting with Vasily Kandinsky and typography, creating the Universal alphabet, a typeface consisting of only lowercase letters that would become the signature font of the Bauhaus.</p>

            <p class="block__body">Shift from the illustrator-as-creator to the constructor-as-creator or nonlinear-narrator-as-creator. In the visual language of the constructor or Constructivist, the Stenbergs and other graphic designers and artists assembled images, such as portions of photographs and preprinted paper, that had been created by others. Thus, the Stenbergs and others realized wholly new images (or compositions) which were no longer about realism. Hence, graphic design as a modern expression eschewing traditional fine art was born in the form of the printed reproductions of collage or assemblage. One of the causes of the avant-garde artists in the new Russia, who considered fine art to be useless, was served when the Stenbergs and others as constructors-as-creators produced posters that had a use, particularly to serve the state. Commercial graphic design and advertising is propaganda, the dissemination of propaganda (пропаганды) was considered a desirable and honorable practice in Russia at the time. In fact, the Bolsheviks, who sought to reform the peasant class, considered film to be a potent propaganda tool for communicating with a widely illiterate population.</p>

            <h3 class="block__artist">El Lissitzky</h3>
            <p class="block__body">The essence of New Vision photography is pointedly expressed in this picture, commonly known as The Constructor, which puts the act of seeing at center stage. Lissitzky's hand, holding a compass, is superimposed on a shot of his head that explicitly highlights his eye: insight, it expresses, is passed through the eye and transmitted to the hand, and through it to the tools of production. Devised from six different exposures, the picture merges Lissitzky's personae as photographer (eye) and constructor of images (hand) into a single likeness. Contesting the idea that straight photography provides a single, unmediated truth, Lissitzky held instead that montage, with its layering of one meaning over another, impels the viewer to reconsider the world. It thus marks a conceptual shift in the understanding of what a picture can be.</p>

            <h3 class="block__artist">Paul Renner</h3>
            <p class="block__body">Based on geometric shapes that became representative of visual elements of the Bauhaus design style of 1919–33. Futura has an appearance of efficiency and forwardness. Although Renner was not associated with the Bauhaus, he shared many of its idioms and believed that a modern typeface should express modern models, rather than be a revival of a previous design. Renner's design rejected the approach of most previous sans-serif designs (now often called grotesques), which were based on the models of signpainting, condensed lettering and nineteenth-century serif typefaces, in favour of simple geometric forms: near-perfect circles, triangles and squares. It is based on strokes of near-even weight, which are low in contrast. The lowercase has tall ascenders, which rise above the cap line, and uses a single-story 'a' and 'g', previously more common in handwriting than in printed text.</p>

            <p class="block__body">This advertising poster for Nord Express was designed by Adolphe Mouron Cassandre in 1927. It shows a stylised image of a train speeding towards the horizon, with a cloud of smoke and a blue sky above it. This poster was included in the V&A's Art Deco exhibition in 2003. The visual language owes much to Cubism, but belongs to the Art Deco in its imagery and the unmistakable modernity of the subject matter. The image communicates the glamour of travel in simple lines.</p>

            <h3 class="block__artist">Herbert Matter</h3>
            <p class="block__body">Herbert Matter (1907-1984) created the 1934 Swiss tourism poster and was instrumental in creating posters which used a photomontage effect whereas multiple photo's would be edited onto one final production piece.  This new "image of images" was then photographed into a seamless picture for poster use.  "Before color photography, Matter who was known as a darkroom perfectionist who could achieve a freshness and harmony in his colors and photographic surfaces by dyeing various elements photo-chemically." The art of photomontage had its roots in Berlin after the First World War whereas a group known as Dada lead by John Heartfeld and George Grosz were experimenting with new art forms without using paint for art.  "Matter’s advanced techniques in graphic design and photography became part of a new visual narrative that began in the 1930s, which have since evolved into familiar design idioms such as overprinting—where an image extends beyond the frame—and the bold use of color, size, and placement in typography. Such techniques often characterize both pre-war European Modernism and the post-war expression of that movement in the United States." Some of Matter's posters follow a design that is rooted in the early 1930s, whereas the close cropped, "heroic head" is at the forefront of the poster.  The presentation of this "herioc head" with little or no facial expression that stares away from the viewer gives the impression of aloofness and total dedication to a greater power."</p>

            <p class="block__body">Marguerite Tjader Harris was the daughter of a wealthy Connecticut munitions manufacturer. She was intent on having Rand design covers for Direction, an arts and culture magazine that she published on a shoestring, which featured articles by Le Corbusier, Jean Cocteau, and other avant-gardists. She offered Rand no recompense, but plenty of freedom and, ultimately, a couple of original Le Corbusier drawings. But Rand has another motive, “In a country that was used to decorative work, the common sense way to have what I was doing accepted was to do it for free,”. Each Direction cover illustrated a particular theme or point of view; the first, and his most politically astute, showed a map of Czechoslovakia torn in half, representing the nation’s evisceration by the Nazis. Contrasted with an E. McKnight Kauffer Direction covers showing a realistic hand impaled by a Nazi dagger, Rand’s abstract depiction was both subtle and eloquent. Rand avoided conventional propagandistic tools in favor of imagery he believed would serve as both art and message. </p>

            <h3 class="block__artist">William Golden</h3>
            <p class="block__body">The famous eye symbol was developed to provide special identification for CBS Television. Kurt Weihs, who was involved in the project, remembers that the eye had its beginnings in an article in Portfolio about the then relatively esoteric subject of Shaker design. “Among the illustrations was an eye symbol. Golden picked it up and used it for a CBS sales portfolio. Then he felt there was more to it and used it in an ad. I redesigned the earlier versions, and it became the mark for CBS Television. We had done eyes before. Everybody had done eyes; but this one was something that really worked. I felt that the eye could have become the corporate symbol. We saw the eye as symbolizing CBS 'looking at the world.'” William Golden applied new ideas, forms, and methods to the world of advertising and promotional graphics. The body of his work endures as a milestone in the history of graphic design. Providing a map of uncharted territory, Golden's program of promotional advertising and identity design for CBS was innovative and set a standard of excellence which has endured over the years. “I think that all the trouble in this field comes from someone's assumption that they are, maybe, the same person. I think the fine artist makes a personal statement about his world and his reactions to his world. He makes it to a limited audience or to a big audience—but it's all his. The advertising designer has a completely different function. He may be someone who thought he wanted to be a painter—but wasn't. If (the designer) is honest enough, he becomes a professional who can do something that is not his own. I think the trouble comes when he tries to make it a work of art, too. I think a lot of designers who are talented and intelligent don't find this very satisfying. But they're not going to find it more satisfying by pretending it's something it isn't.”</p>

            <h2 class="block__title">Grove Press Paperback</h2>
            <h3 class="block__artist">Roy Kuhlman</h3>
            <p class="block__body">While Kuhlman generally did not read the books, he did attempt to convey the message of the title. That approach coupled with his abstract style seems to make the covers appear to be arbitrarily executed. But, in fact, his work is the result of exacting visual decisions. He worked in a pure, visual language, moving elements around on a page until they “felt right.” This created a loose connection between the literature and the covers but it was subliminal—the covers did not literally express the content but announced that both were “avant-garde.” Almost from the start, Kuhlman’s covers gave Grove Press a unique identity. Rosset had few rules for covers other than that the title and author’s name be horizontal. Rosset was cognizant of the visual aesthetic for European paperbacks and sought an equally avant-garde but different look for his North American market. Rosset’s insight and Kuhlman’s talent created the Grove Press look. While the two were never close friends, theirs was a symbiotic relationship. Rosset bought the rights to new and interesting writers’ works, and Kuhlman created the designs that got the attention of an emerging educated middle class. He helped Grove Press become a publishing company with intellectual cachet. Stylistically, three dominant graphic themes emerge in Kuhlman’s work: abstract, photographic, and typographic. Although these styles are often combined, each cover does follow a major focus. Kuhlman’s typographic covers emphasize shape over classic type styling. He saw type as an element on a page—a shape to be finessed, manipulated and arranged. Kuhlman usually kept the image and main text (title and author) separate but was more playful with the Grove Press logo. Always budget-conscious, he would attach bits of type to other work that was being enlarged or reduced, then cut up the letterforms to use in future covers. Kuhlman’s type covers are minimal and powerful, and illustrate his ability to maintain a consistent style even when a traditional image was not the dominant theme.</p>

            <p class="block__body">Released by his employer Deberny & Peignot in 1957. Classified as a neo-grotesque sans-serif, one based on the model of nineteenth-century German typefaces such as Akzidenz-Grotesk, it was notable for its availability from the moment of its launch in a comprehensive range of weights and widths. The original marketing for Univers deliberately referenced the periodic table to emphasise its scope. Univers was one of the first typeface families to fulfil the idea that a typeface should form a family of consistent, related designs. Past sans-serif designs such as Gill Sans had much greater differences between weights</p>

            <h3 class="block__artist">Saul Bass</h3>
            <p class="block__body">He created an arresting image of a distorted, disjointed arm. The semi-abstract form helped distance the image from the harsh realities of shooting up, although they are implicit in the (dis)figuration. As well as being disconnected from a body, the black arm has the appearance of being petrified and transformed into something else, just as the Sinatra character in the film is transformed by his addiction. The title sequence was equally compelling. Here was modern art on the movie screen. Saul stated that, “The intent of this opening was to create a mood spare, gaunt, with a driving intensity… [that conveyed] the distortion and jaggedness, the disconnectedness and disjointedness of the addict’s life the subject of the film.” Accompanied by Elmer Bernstein’s driving jazz-like score, and set against a black background, white bars appear, disappear and form abstract patterns before finally coalescing into the film’s symbol. Contrasts between the black and white heighten the strident intensity, and the disjunctures encapsulate the mood of the main character, a downbeat drummer with a penchant for gambling and drugs.</p>

            <h3 class="block__artist">Lester Beall</h3>
            <p class="block__body">The Lester Beall International Paper Company logo design, 1960. Initials, tree, and upward arrow combine in a mark whose fundamental simplicity - an isometric triangle in a circle - assures a timeless harmony. In discussing his logo for one of the largest paper manufacturers in the world, Beall wrote, ''Our assignment was to provide management with a strong mark that could be readily adapted to an immense variety of applications. This ranged from its bold use on the barks of trees to its intricate involvement in repeat patterns, carton designs, labels, trucks. In addition to its functional strength, the new mark is a powerful force in stimulating and integrating divisional and corporate identity with positive psychological effects on human relations''. The International Paper Company logo design was controversial in the design community when it first appeared: The letters I and P are distorted to make a tree symbol, and critics questioned whether letterforms should be altered to this extreme. The continuing viability of this mark since its inception indicates that Beall's critics were overly cautious.</p>

            <h2 class="block__title">Title sequence Dr. Strangelove</h2>
            <h3 class="block__artist">Pablo Ferro</h3>
            <p class="block__body">Ferro’s loose letterforms and slack compositions superimposed over aircraft footage represented a distinct departure from American title design of the time. Prior to 1966, the aesthetic of main titles was defined primarily by designers such as the Basses, Binder, and Brownjohn and their symbolic geometry, clean typography, and bold graphic forms. The stage was set for Ferro’s strain of ambitious artistry. His lettering, variously squat, long, and lean, allows the footage to peek through, unobtrusive but utterly individual. It was all done by hand, with grease pencil on glass.</p>

            <h3 class="block__artist">Andy Warhol</h3>
            <p class="block__body">When Warhol first exhibited these Campbell’s Soup Cans in 1962, they were displayed together on shelves, like products in a grocery aisle. Though Campbell’s Soup Cans resembles the mass-produced, printed advertisements by which Warhol was inspired, it is hand-painted, while the fleur de lys pattern ringing each can’s bottom edge is hand-stamped. In this work, he mimicked the repetition and uniformity of advertising by carefully reproducing the same image across each individual canvas. He varied only the label on the front of each can, distinguishing them by their variety. Towards the end of 1962, shortly after he completed Campbell’s Soup Cans, Warhol turned to the photo-silkscreen process. A printmaking technique originally invented for commercial use, it would become his signature medium and link his art making methods more closely to those of advertisements.</p>

Rather than catering to the design sensitivity of the general public, there is advancement in design if people are left to feel satisfied with their own superiority, by entrapping them with visual illusion.”</p>
